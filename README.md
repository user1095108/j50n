# j50n
This repository implements ideas related to the fantastic [js0n](https://github.com/quartzjer/js0n) library and its [fork](https://github.com/nigoroll/js0n/tree/pr_case). The essence of js0n is its [FSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)  implementation. This implementation could be improved, but for now, we rely on the original ported to c++.
